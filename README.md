# Traffic_Prediction
•	Data Source and Processing: using TFL smart sensors and a system architecture to capture, store, managed and visualize information. 
•	Data Integration: automatically select relevant data when Extracting, Transforming and Loading using Beam to help reshape and calculate traffic metrics to eliminate the need for data stagging. Apache Beam is an open-source unified model that is used for defining batch and stream processing pipelines.  
•	Predictive System Architecture: implementation of a comprehensive real-time predictive monitoring system integrated with detailed visualisation of the current and projected situation of the traffic transport system, applicable to buses, trains, and cars.
