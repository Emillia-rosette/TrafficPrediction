# Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques To Predict Road Traffic Impact For Better Roadwork Planning and Coordination

The aim of the project is to design an architecture system to integrate and visualise information in real-time on a predictive monitoring system to support transport strategic decisions including scheduling road works, passengerâ€™s time and stops usage!

# Introduction

A novel deep learning architecture to capture uncommon traffic situations to tackle traffic constraints on the traffic intensity during peak versus off peak hours based on proposed traffic closures.
