# Optimizing Traffic Prediction and Roadwork Impact Assessment using Neural Networks for Effective Planning Coordination

**The aims of the project:**

1. Develop and implement a neural network-based traffic prediction model that accurately forecasts traffic conditions in urban areas such as London, considering diverse factors such as historical traffic data, weather conditions, and events.
2.	Explore and optimize the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model road networks and assess the potential impacts of roadwork on traffic flow, enabling proactive and effective roadwork planning.


This repository contains several basic operations such as loading the dataset, displaying an overview, calculating totals for specific categories, grouping the data by various parameters, and saving the analysis results to a new CSV file.

## Overview

The code uses Pandas for data manipulation and provides the following functionalities:

1. **Load Dataset:** Reads the traffic data from a CSV file.
2. **Preview Data:** Prints the first 5 rows to get an overview of the data.
3. **Basic Statistics:** Calculates and prints descriptive statistics for each column.
4. **Calculate Totals:** Computes the total counts for specific columns such as 'cars_and_taxis' and 'pedal_cycles'.
5. **Group By Year and Region:** Groups the data by 'year' and 'region_name', then prints the sum for each group.
6. **Save Results:** Saves the result of the grouped-by-region analysis to a CSV file.

## Dependencies

- Pandas

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Pandas installed in your Python environment.
2. Update the path to the CSV file in the script as per your local setup.
3. Run the script using:

```bash
python script_name.py
